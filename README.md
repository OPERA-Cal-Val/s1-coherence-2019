# Loading Annual Coherence (2019-2020) Data from Sentinel-1

A good description of the source dataset and its generation can be found here: https://registry.opendata.aws/ebd-sentinel-1-global-coherence-backscatter/. There are several more usage examples there in notebook form.

Currently, we are looking only at 12 day coherence data. The notebooks can easily be changed for inspecting different data that is apart of this large collection.

Main goal of this repository is to:

1. Perform tile-by-tile analysis of 12-day coherence for OPERA validation
2. Visualize the 12-day coherence data
